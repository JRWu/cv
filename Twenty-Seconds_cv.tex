\aboutme{
I am a software engineer and academic. I have been writing software for over a decade starting with Java/C, analyzing data with R/Python, and building models using Tensorflow. Throughout my career, I've built startups from the ground-up, taught at academic institutions, and driven revenue generating operations for enterprises.
